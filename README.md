  Fetus problems are the major reasons in gynecology for pregnant women's.  If the conditions for the fetus inside womb are not appropriate,  then there are major chances of health detrioration of the fetus.  Cardiotocography technique is used to record the fetal heart rate and uterine contraction simultaneously.  Using machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree(DT), Support vector Machine (SVM), Naive bayes(NB) and Random forest(RF).  The data set is extracted from the UGI Machine Learning Repository and classified into a fetal state by means of a normal,suspicious and pathological class that is trained and tested using algorithms and compared on the basis of different performance measures.
